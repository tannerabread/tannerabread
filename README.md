## Hey, I'm Bannon

Iâ€™m a full-stack engineer who likes getting into the details of tough systems, refactoring old code, and setting up architecture that makes development smoother over time. Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and C#/.NET â€” building features, cleaning up tech debt, and mentoring other devs along the way.

I like working on things that make a real difference in how fast and confidently a team can ship code. Whether itâ€™s cutting down redundancy, simplifying processes, or debugging difficult problems, Iâ€™m usually looking for the spots that slow people down â€” and figuring out how to fix them.
